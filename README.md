# SecureTI

## This project was created as an educational tool to raise awareness about database security and best practices in information security.

It simulates a learning platform where users can explore key concepts of database protection, encryption, vulnerabilities, and practical measures to improve security in real-life applications.

This full-stack web application was built using:

- React.TS
- Next.JS
- Tailwind CSS
- MongoDB
- NextAuth (for authentication)
- Mongoose (ORM)
